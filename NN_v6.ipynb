The reviews were seen as a potential source of raw implicit feedback (e.g. analyzing the sentiment of the review) as well as a way of extracting more detailed content about the products. The texts typically sought to combine LDA and MF (matrix factorization) either through bayesian approaches or neural networks. The two main .. we have used.."

    "In total 493 (0.5%) reviews were \"doubles\" of a former review - duplicates meaning that the same person reviewed the same product with the only difference being the review text. Manual inspection of these 'double'-reviews showed that they were likely due to the reviewer making small changes in the text of the review - e.g. change from 'excellemt product' to 'excellent product' - and the 'double' reviews were typically close in time - typically on the same day. Because so few reviews are affected, in case of double reviews, only the most recent review was kept. If it had been the case that the 'double' reviews were due to the person buying the same product 6 months later and changing his/her opinion then the procedure should've been different. However, as this does not appear to be the case we will not spend more time analyzing 'double' reviews."
